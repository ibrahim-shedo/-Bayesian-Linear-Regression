# Bayesian Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements Bayesian Linear Regression using a synthetic healthcare dataset. The dataset simulates various health-related features to predict a risk score for patients. The model aims to illustrate how Bayesian methods can provide probabilistic estimates for linear regression.

## Dataset
The synthetic dataset includes the following features:
- **age**: Age of the patient (integer)
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (float)
- **blood_pressure**: Blood pressure level (integer)
- **cholesterol**: Cholesterol level (integer)
- **heart_rate**: Heart rate (beats per minute) (integer)
- **smoking_status**: Smoking status (1 for smoker, 0 for non-smoker) (integer)
- **exercise_level**: Exercise level (1 to 5, where 1 is low and 5 is high) (integer)
- **risk_score**: Target variable (predicted risk score) (float)

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Data Generation: The dataset is generated synthetically using NumPy.
Model Training: The Bayesian Linear Regression model is trained using the BayesianRidge class from scikit-learn.
Prediction: The model predicts risk scores on the test dataset.
Visualization: A scatter plot is created to compare actual vs. predicted risk scores.
Results
The model outputs coefficients and an intercept for each feature.
A plot visualizes the actual vs. predicted risk scores, allowing for evaluation of model performance.
